All of my computer automation scripts, prepared to be used with launchy, written mostly in AutoHotkey and python


# how to setup
1. Clone this repository into "C:\" directory
2. Install Autohotkey

5. On Launchy>Options>General>User Interface>Hotkey set hotkey to "Ctrl+Win" "F13"
6. You Might want to add or remove some plugins for Launchy at Launchy>Options>Plugins

  "Launchy",  
  "C\AHK\Extra_Keyboard.ahk",  
  "C:\AHK\Intercept\intercept_tray.ahk"(if you want to enable second keyboard for macros)
